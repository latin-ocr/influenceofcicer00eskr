The above passages from Cyprian and St. Ambrose maintain
the same *characteristics of rhetoric as those found in the writings
of the Apostle Paul.

They are didactic throughout, and set forth, the one treating of
the Sacrament, the other of the equality of the Holy Spirit with the
F ather and with the Son, cardinal principles in a terse and vigorous
way. They are admirably adapted to teaching, and conform in all
respects to the Submissa Dicti0.
