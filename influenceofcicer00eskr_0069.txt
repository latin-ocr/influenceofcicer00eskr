SUMMARY 57

in clearing up difficult matters containing technicalities and obscuri—
ties; and that the term, Plain Style, refers exclusively to the diction
or phraseology, and not to the thought, which may be exceedingly
terse and complicated; that as Cicero used this style in difficult
cases pertaining to matters of law, so does Augustine parallel Cicero
by showing the fitness of the Plain Style in dealing with like sub-
jectS‚ such as the Mosaic Law, for instance; that the function of
the Middle Style is to please by beauty of diction and ornamentation
of style ; to conciliate, and to put the hearers in a friendly, attentive,
and teachable frame of mind, so that they may be the more easily
influenced by the orator in any way he may see fit to direct; that
this conception is taken entirely from Cicero as shown most clearly
from the Orator; that the object of the Grand Style is to move men
to action by the power and vehemence of speech3 that it consists
of a vehement and powert'ul character, and that this vehemence is,
in the main, one of thought and mental emotion vigorously com-
pressed within strong and commanding language3 that wherever
need may be, it is the province of this style to break through the
most stubborn and obdurate natures and compel them to do the bid-
ding of the orator3 and that this conception also is taken wholly
from Cicero as abundantly set forth in his oratorical theory.

Again, if the orator would not grow tiresome and tedious to his
hearerS, he must alternate the employment of these styles, now using
the one, and now the other, and that in doing s0, the utmost skill
and caution should be exercised in order that he may best advance
the interest of the undertaking he may have at hand, and that, fur-
thermore, this conception is also taken wholly from Cicero,

Also, that, as regards the interpretation of these divisions of
style, the first and logical division that Augustine made of the fourth
book os De Doctrina Christiana, was a two-sold one, that of philoso-
phy, or Scripture and rhetoric; that this division is in all essential
respects the same as that made in Contra C resconiunm that the two-
fold division into philosophy, or Scriptum, and rhetoric, is a recog·
nition of the respective claims of philosophy and rhetoric, as was
also recognized by Cicero ; that as Cicero finally made a three—sold
division of style, as seen in the Bru-tm, so does Augustine also fol-
low him in this respect.

Again, that as regards the character of the eloquence of Augus-
tine's orator, since there is an eloquence suitable to youth, and one
