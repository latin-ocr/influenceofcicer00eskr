INTERPRETATION OF DIVISIONS OF STYLE 29

to persuade ; and to accomplish which, as has been seen, the orator
must employ the Plain, the Middle, and the Grand Styles of oratory.
To employ the Plain Style is to use dialectic, or Scripture, of Contra
Cresconimn,· or reS, or Scripture, of De Doctrina Christiana. To
employ the Middle or Grand Style, is to use the modus quo, or
rhetoric, of both treatiseS. To speak copiose ornateque (Contra
Cres, Ι, 16), and etiam veraciter, is to be eloquent, to employ the
Middle Style when the object is to please, and the Grand Style when
the hearer is to be stirred and aroused to action: to discuss a subject
subtiliter (ibid.‚ and Brutus, 2389), arguteque and veraciter (Contra
Cres. Ι, 16), is to use the Plain Style when the purpose is to teach,
to define, or to refute an error, or to handle subjects involving
technicalitieS, difficulties and obscurities. In short, explicare or-
nateque copiose, and etiam veraciter, is to be eloquent, to be con-
cerned with the modus quo ; while subtiliter arguteque disserere, and
autem presse atque constricte (Contra Cres. Ι, 20), as for instance,
de circumcisione, vel distinctione legis et gratiae (ibid), is to be a
dialectician, a teacher, a debater rather than an eloquent man—one
whose purpose it is to be a master of res,

The treatise, Contra C resconium‚ thus affords us the key to the
interpretation3 of the three-sold division of styles in the fourth book
of De Doctrina Christiana.. The Plain Style is dialectic, the Middle
and the Grand Styles, rhetoric; the synthesis ot* the two elements
goes back to the time when the rhetoricians began to recognize the
necessity of more exact proof. It can be traced to HermagoraS, who
is, perhapS‚ the author of the three-sold style, and Cicero, in Delnven-
tione, ΙΙ, 2.7 and 8, says: Atque alii quoque alio ex fonte praeceptores
dicendi emanaverunt, qui item permultum ad (licendum, si quid ars
proficit, opitulati sunt. Nam fuit tempore eodem, quo AristoteleS‚
magnus et nobilis rhetor Isocrates; cuius ipsius quam constet esse
artem, non invenimus. Discipulorum autem atque eorum, qui pro-
tinus ab hac sunt disciplina profecti, multa de arte praecepta reperi-
mus. Ex his duabus diversis sicuti familiis, quarum altera quum
versaretur in philosophia, nonnullam rhetoricae quoque artis sibi
curam adsumebat, altera vero omnis in dicendi erat studio et prae-
ceptione occupata, unum quoddam est conflatum genus a posteriori-
bus, qui ab utrisque ea, quae commode dici videbantur, in suas artes
contulerunt.
