54 CICERO'S INFLUENCE UPON AUGUSTINE'S ORATORICAL THEORY

Si ergo loquitur in eis Spiritus Sanctu5‚ qui persequentibus traduntur
pro Christo, cur non et in eis qui tradunt discentibus Christum?

(D. D. C. IV, 15. 32).

Finally Augustine advances the doctrine that a man who has
a good delivery; but who is unable to compose anything worth de—
livering, may avail himself of that which has been written, with
wisdom and eloquence, by another. He may commit it to memory
and deliver it to the people without being charged with practicing
deception. In this way many become proclaimers of the truth and
yet not many teachers, for in the last analysiS, the ecclesiastical
orator delivers that which the Great Teacher has composed. Sunt
sane quidam qui bene pronuntiare possunt, quid autern pronuntient,
excogitare non possunt. Quod si ab aliis sumant eloquenter sapien-
terque conscriptum‚ memoriaeque commendent, atque ad populum
proferant; si eam personam gerunt, non improbe faciunt. Sic enim,
quod profecto utile est, multi praedicatores veritatis fiunt, nec multi
magistri, si unius veri magistri idipsum dicant omneS, et non sint

in eis schismata. (D. D. C. IV, 29. 62).
