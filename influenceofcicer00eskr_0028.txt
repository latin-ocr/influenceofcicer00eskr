111. THE OFFICES OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL ORATOR

After having treated of the ecclesiastical orator in the manner
as shown in the preceding chapter, Augustine proceeds to discuss
the specific duties of the orator. His moral character, his educa-
tion in general, his study of rhetoric in early youth, his store of
wisdom, his mastery of the general laws of eloquence, must all be
directed to a specific purpose if he would not be foredoomed to a
speedy and ignominious failure. In accordance with Cicero, he
assigns to the ecclesiastical orator three main officeS, which, at the
same time, are both natural and psychological. They are natural
because they make the function of the orator commensurate with
the mental possibilities of man, and they are pyschological because
each specific duty of the orator is adapted to a special faculty of
the human mind. These three offices are, (Ι) to instruct; (2) to
please; (3) to move; and their natural and legitimate spheres of
action are in the regionS, (1) of the intellect; (2) of the sensibili-
ties; (3) of the will, respectively. To instruct is of the intellect,
to arouse or soothe the emotionS, to move the will is the orator’s part
of the program in dealing with humanity, as seen by both Cicero
and Augustine. To reach the standard of excellence in the art of
speaking, wherein the skill of the orator appeals with equal force
to the soul of man, through any or all of these avenueS, is to be a
great orator; while to stir men to frenzy, or to arouse them to action
even against their wills, is the problem of a Demosthenes or a
Savonarola, a Cicero or a Spurgeon.

As regards these offices of the ecclesiastical orator, Augustine,
D. D. C. IV, 12. 27, says: Dixit ergo quidam eloquenS, et verum
dixit, ita dicere debere eloquentem, ut doceat, ut delectet, ut flectat.

This three-sold function of the orator, he specifically stateS, was
so defined by CicerO, who, in the Ora-tor, 21. 69. says: Erit igitur
eloquens—hunc enim auctore Antonio quaerimus—is, qui in foro
causisque civilibus ita dicet, ut probet. ut delectet, ut flectat. Probare
necessitatis est, delectare suavitatis, flectere victoriae: narn id unum
ex omnibus ad obtinendas causas potest plurimum. Sed quot officia
oratoriS, tot sunt genera dicendi: subtile in proband0‚ modicum in
delectandO, vehemens in flecten‹lo; in quo uno vis omnis oratoris est.
It will be observed here that Augustine does not quote Cicero cor-
