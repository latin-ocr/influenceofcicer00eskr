28 c1cERo's INFLUENCE UPON AUGUs‘nNE's onA‘rochL ‘rm-:onir

By reference to De Oratore, 11, 77.310‚ it will be seen? that
Augustine derives this two-sold division of his oratorical system
from Cicer0. He says: Tribus rebus homines ad nostram sententiam
perducimuS, aut docendo aut conciliando aut permovendo, una ex
tribus his rebus res prae nobis est ferenda, ut nihil aliud nisi docere
velle videamur; reliquae duae, sicuti sanguis in corporibuS, sic illae
in perpetuis orationibus fusae esse debebunt.

Again in the Brutus, 23. 89: Duae summae sint in oratore laudes,
una subtiliter disputandi ad docendum, altera graviter agendi ad
animos audientium permovendos

This dual division, in the oratorical system of Augustine is,
therefore, clearly taken from Cicer0, and due consideration should
be attached to this fact, since it is the vital nexus between these two
systems of oratory, the one legal, the other Christian. It is pre-
cisely at this point that Augustine draws on Cicero for the founda-
tion principles οἱ his oratorical theory, which, when fully appreci-
ated by the student of both masters, makes the comparison of their
respective systems a relatively easy matter. In the broadest of essen·
tials, they are identical, and it follows as a natural sequence, that, in
so far as the nature of the oratorical training of the Ecclesiasticus
will permit, it must be the same as that of the Juris ConsultuS.

The final step in the basic partitioning is a natural one and easily
taken. Since there are two universal principles in oratory, the one
dealing with the subject matter, the other with the manner of de-
livery, the latter divides itself, naturally, into two partS, the one of
pleasing, the other of moving men. This final and complete division
into three parts is seen in the Brutus, 49. 185: Tria sunt enim, ut
quidem ego sentio, quae sint efficienda dicendo; ut doceatur is, apud
quem dicetur, ut delectetur, ut moveatur. Now what Augustine in
reality does, is to accept the three-sold division of Cicero, (D. D. C.
IV, 12. 27).'·' and then point out that the first deals with res, subject
matter, or Scripture, and the other two with the modus quo of de·
livery, or rhetoric. From the standpoint os either conception. either
of the dual or οἱ the tripartite, the function of the one part is to
teach, that of the other, or other two, to deal purely with the art of
expression. This, then. on the reverse curve of the same circle,
returns to the functions of the orator, which are to teach, to delight,
