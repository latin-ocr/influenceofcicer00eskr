8 CICERO'S ιΝηυεΝεε UPON Aucus‘rmss’s omi-omen TnssoRY

It is thus fair to conclude, that, with the exception of the idea
that the moral character of the ecclesiastical orator may not be with-
out serious defectS, and yet that his preaching may be beneficial to
his hearerS, the conception of Augustine as regards the moral char-
acter of his orator is the same as that of Cicero regarding his ideal
orator, and that this exception is more apparent than real, inasmuch
as it is the message of the ecclesiastical orator and not the orator
himself that countS.

(a) The Ecclesiastico! Orator and His Duty

The orator of St. Augustine is the divinarum Scripturarum trac-
tator et doctor, defensor rectae fidei ac debellator erroris. It is his
office to teach the true saith, and to urge men and women to accept
it. It is his duty bona docere et mala dedocere; atque in hoc opere
sermonis conciliare adversos, remissos erigere, nescientibus quid
agatur, quid exspectare debeant intimare. Ubi autem benevo108,
intentOS, dociles aut invenerit, aut ipse fecerit, cetera peragenda
sunt, sicut postulat causa. Si docendi sunt qui audiunt, narratione
faciendum est, si tamen indigeat, ut res de qua agitur innotescat. Ut
autem quae dubia sunt certa fiant, documentis adhibitis ratiocinan-
dum est. Si vero qui audiunt movendi sunt potius quam docendi,
ut in eo quo iam sciunt, agendo non torpeant et rebus assensum, quas
veras esse fatentur, accommodent, maioribus dicendi viribus opus
est. Ibi obsecrationes et increpationes, concitationes et coercitioneS‚
et quaecumque alia volent ad commovendos animOS, sunt neces—
saria. (D. D. C. IV, 4. 6.)

It is, then, the duty of the ecclesiastical orator to teach the truth,
to refute error, to conciliate the hostile, to arouse the apathetic, to
render those who hear attentive‚ to make plain that which is obscure,
to entreat, to reproach, to upbraid, to exhort to duty; in fine, to
make use of all the means possible to cause his hearers to act.

(b) Cicero's Ideol Orator and His Duty

with reference to Cicero’s ideal orator, whom he defines in
Orator, 2, 7 and 8; and as to his duties which he mentions in general
terms in De Orat. 1, 8, and Orator, 2, 8 and 9, (the two latter under
the forms of exquisite eulogies on the art of eloquence)—in Orator,
2, 7 and 8. he says: Atque ego in summo oratore fingendo talem
